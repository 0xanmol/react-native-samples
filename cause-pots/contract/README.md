# Cause Pots Smart Contract

A Solana smart contract for group savings with time-locked PDAs and multi-signature release mechanisms. Built with Anchor framework.

## Overview

Cause Pots enables groups to save SOL together with built-in protections:
- **Time-Lock**: Funds cannot be released until a specified unlock date
- **Multi-Signature**: Requires M-of-N contributor signatures to release funds
- **Contributor Tracking**: Detailed tracking of individual contributions
- **Authority Management**: Pot creator can add new contributors

## Deployment

**Network:** Solana Devnet

## Instructions

### create_pot

Create a new savings pot with time-lock and multi-sig configuration.

**Parameters:**
- `name: String` - Pot name (max 32 characters)
- `description: String` - Pot description (max 200 characters)
- `target_amount: u64` - Target savings goal in lamports
- `unlock_days: i64` - Number of days until unlock (converted to timestamp internally)
- `signers_required: u8` - Number of signatures needed for release

**Validations:**
- Name length ≤ 32 characters
- Description length ≤ 200 characters
- Target amount > 0
- Unlock days > 0 (internally converted to Unix timestamp: `current_time + days * 86400`)
- Signers required > 0

**Example:**
```typescript
await program.methods
  .createPot(
    "Trip Fund",
    "Saving for Tokyo trip",
    new anchor.BN(50 * LAMPORTS_PER_SOL),
    new anchor.BN(30),
    2
  )
  .accounts({
    pot: potPDA,
    authority: authority.publicKey,
    systemProgram: SystemProgram.programId,
  })
  .signers([authority])
  .rpc();
```

### contribute

Contribute SOL to a pot. Automatically creates contributor account on first contribution.

**Parameters:**
- `amount: u64` - Amount to contribute in lamports

**Validations:**
- Amount > 0
- Pot not already released

**Behavior:**
- Transfers SOL from contributor to pot PDA
- Updates pot's total_contributed
- Adds contributor to contributors list if new
- Creates/updates ContributorAccount

**Example:**
```typescript
await program.methods
  .contribute(new anchor.BN(2 * LAMPORTS_PER_SOL))
  .accounts({
    pot: potPDA,
    contributorAccount: contributorPDA,
    contributor: contributor.publicKey,
    systemProgram: SystemProgram.programId,
  })
  .signers([contributor])
  .rpc();
```

### sign_release

Sign to approve fund release (multi-sig voting).

**Validations:**
- Pot not already released
- Signer is a contributor
- Signer hasn't already signed
- Time-lock has expired

**Example:**
```typescript
await program.methods
  .signRelease()
  .accounts({
    pot: potPDA,
    signer: contributor.publicKey,
  })
  .signers([contributor])
  .rpc();
```

### release_funds

Release pot funds to a recipient. Requires signature threshold and authority.

**Parameters:**
- `recipient: Pubkey` - Address to receive funds

**Validations:**
- Pot not already released
- Time-lock has expired
- Signature threshold met
- Sufficient funds after rent-exempt reserve

**Behavior:**
- Transfers SOL from pot PDA to recipient
- Marks pot as released
- Records release timestamp and recipient

**Example:**
```typescript
await program.methods
  .releaseFunds(recipient.publicKey)
  .accounts({
    pot: potPDA,
    authority: authority.publicKey,
    recipient: recipient.publicKey,
  })
  .signers([authority])
  .rpc();
```

### add_contributor

Add a new contributor to the pot. Authority only.

**Parameters:**
- `new_contributor: Pubkey` - Public key of new contributor

**Validations:**
- Pot not already released
- Contributor not already in list

**Example:**
```typescript
await program.methods
  .addContributor(newContributor.publicKey)
  .accounts({
    pot: potPDA,
    authority: authority.publicKey,
  })
  .signers([authority])
  .rpc();
```

## Development

### Prerequisites
- Rust 1.89.0
- Solana CLI 3.1.3
- Anchor CLI 0.32.1
- Node.js 16+

### Setup
```bash
anchor build
anchor test
```

### Deploy

## Complete Usage Flow

```typescript
// 1. Create pot with time-lock and 2-of-3 multi-sig
await program.methods.createPot(
  "Trip Fund", "Tokyo trip", new BN(50 * LAMPORTS_PER_SOL), new BN(30), 2
).rpc();

// 2. Contributors contribute
await program.methods.contribute(new BN(2 * LAMPORTS_PER_SOL)).rpc();

// 3. After time-lock, contributors sign (2 required)
await program.methods.signRelease().rpc();
await program.methods.signRelease().rpc();

// 4. Authority releases funds
await program.methods.releaseFunds(recipient.publicKey).rpc();
```

See tests for complete examples.

## Security Considerations

### Implemented Protections

- Time-lock enforcement via Clock
- Multi-signature threshold validation
- Authority-only controls with constraints
- PDA security with deterministic addresses
- Arithmetic safety with checked operations
- State immutability for released pots

### Known Limitations

- No withdrawal mechanism for contributors
- Fixed multi-sig configuration after creation
- Authority trust required for final release
